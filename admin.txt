 Certainly! Here's a simple set of Git commands for a basic demonstration. This assumes you have Git installed on your machine and have a GitHub account for remote repositories.

1. **Initialize a new Git repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Create a new file:**
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Git!" > hello.txt
   ```

3. **Stage the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   ```

4. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Create a new repository (let's call it `git-demo`).

6. **Add the GitHub repository as a remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/git-demo.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

7. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin Main
   ```

8. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

9. **Make changes in the new branch:**
   ```bash
   echo "Feature in progress" > feature.txt
   ```

10. **Commit changes in the new branch:**
   ```bash
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "Add feature"
   ```

11. **Push the new branch to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```

12. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub:**
    - Go to your repository on GitHub.
    - Switch to the `feature-branch`.
    - Click on "New Pull Request" to create a pull request.
